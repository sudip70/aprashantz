            <h3>Influence of technology in our daily life</h3>
            <img src="../images/blog1.JPG" alt="DisplayPicture" width="100%" height="500"> </br>
            <p>
                Over the years, technology has revolutionized our world and daily lives. Technology has created amazing tools and resources,
                 putting useful information at our fingertips.
                Modern technology has paved the way for multi-functional devices like the smartwatch
                 and the smartphone. Computers are increasingly faster, more portable, and higher-powered than ever before.
                  With all of these revolutions, technology has also made our lives easier, faster, better, and more fun.
            </br>
                In this article, we’ll cover how technology has impacted senior’s lives in and out of the home.
                Technology’s advancements have provided quicker ways to communicate through instant messaging apps and social media platforms.
                Seniors are able to keep in touch with loved ones,
                while caregivers have new avenues to check in on aging parents or patients.
            </br>
                Technology has also given us brand new devices in recent decades, like smartwatches, tablets, and
                voice assistant devices. With these devices, we can do things like transfer money instantly and make purchases
                for everything from clothes, food delivery, groceries, furniture, and more. Technology has changed how we entertain
                ourselves, meet each other, and consume all types of media. It’s made fun advancements, but it’s also made
                important advancements in safety when it comes to home security and medical devices.
            </br>
                Especially for seniors, these devices are providing the freedom to age in place, to live independently, and to continue moving through everyday life with peace of mind. It opens up new opportunities by helping with safety, mobility and connectivity. Medical advancements have made it so you can stay proactive with conditions like diabetes and arthritis. With new medical alert devices, seniors can also get help at the push of a button and keep in touch with loved ones no matter where they are in the world.
            </br>
                Since there are so many new technologies to keep track of, it can seem overwhelming to adapt. However, all of these new technologies are designed to make your life easier. Even though it may not feel intuitive, learning how to use smart phones, smartwatches and voice assistants just takes a little bit of instruction and practice.
            </br>
            Social Media

            Who hasn’t heard of Facebook, Twitter, or Skype? They’ve become household names. Even if you don’t use these platforms, they’re a part of everyday life and not going away anytime soon. Regardless of your location, messages via social media get delivered on these platforms at the same rate and speed whether the recipient is right beside you or on the other side of the globe. You can also send voice messages through these platforms, and it is delivered in nanoseconds.
            Messaging Apps
            
            The way we use mobile phones has changed dramatically as well. In addition to social media platforms, there are numerous other applications specifically designed for communication. If social media isn’t for you, WhatsApp and other messaging apps enable you to quickly message family and friends and even make calls over Wi-Fi.
            
            You can email through your phone or send SMS text messages through your mobile provider, but many smartphones have their own messaging platforms built directly into the phone. On Apple iPhones, iMessage allows you communicate with anyone else who has an iPhone for free using WiFi or cellular data. iMessage has gotten increasingly sophisticated over the years. Sending photos, videos and emojis are just the basics with what you can do, and the platform has now expanded to include gaming, voice notes, and various app integrations to send information more quickly.
            
            Messaging Apps can be a great option if you have friends in other countries or if you don’t have a phone plan.
            Smartwatches
            
            Communication has even evolved beyond mobile devices and personal computers. We can now send messages through tablets, voice assistants, smartwatches, and more. The smartwatch is a relatively new technology that captures almost all the capabilities of smartphones in a convenient touch-screen watch. You can receive notifications, track your activity, set alarms, and even call and text directly through these wearable devices.

        <h3>Personal Reflection towards college</h3>
        <img src="../images/meme.JPG" alt="DisplayPicture" width="100%" height="500"> </br>
           <p>
            Finishing the high school and getting ready for further study was an exciting beginning of my journey. Since childhood, I am always a computer guy and learning new things on it, is an exciting part to me as always. As every colleges were offering their best courses, it was a confusing decision to choose my type of IT. After considering things like learning methods, learning environment, future opportunities, global transparency, Islington College was a decision of mine. After enrolling the computing course, Information System became one of my favorite modules. I started preparing the module from various approach of internet, college seniors, reference books. During my vacation time, I had joined the basic web programming class. Their I got the opportunity to learn HTML, CSS. I had also some ideas and work experiences in Unity3D game engine as I was interested in game development since childhood.
            From the early week of the module with the words of lecturer, tutor, I started having so many expectations from the Information System (module). I was introduced about the real world uses of this module. Then I started expecting to build databases, build information system management for organizations. I was expecting to work as a professional of this field from the early stages of my module. To be honest, I was dreaming like I will be able to make databases for organizations, design information management systems after learning for months only. And also started imagining earnings from my skills through free lancing. I was expecting the module to be super easy to learn, be skillful and get ready to solve real world problems. Not only about learning expectations but I was also expecting to have enough leisure time.
            Looking back to my early expectations, I came to believe it’s easier to dream but difficult to implement. To be skillful in any field we must need ideas from basic to complex. We can’t just go to problem solving without knowing the basics of the thing. I was expecting to learn problem solving from the earlier classes of the module which became false reality. To get ready to be a problem solver, we need to go through the basics and concepts. Gradually we can climb up with more and more to learn. It was a funny expectation of mine to know so much within a week and earn doing part time and internship. But now that’s all became false hopes. The module started with the basic concepts, documentation, introduction, small examples to solve and similar things. And my expectation of getting enough leisure time also get wrong. Simply to say I was not able to meet those expectations because my expectations were impractical and hurry.
            Moving to the UK based bachelor program from different learning method, it has been quite new to adopt myself into the new learning method. The new learning method is composed of LTW strategy which means Lecture, Tutorial, Workshop/Lab. We are given with regular assignments and tasks to do. And this is improving our practice and experience. We are required to bring our personnel laptop during lab/tutorial sessions. Biometric attendance system is used in the college for fair and organic attendance records. Till now I am able to meet the formalities and requirements. Being up to date with the lecture slides is being quite time consuming but overall, I am feeling fine with the system.
                Till today, I have no any difficulties with learning mechanism or with any related things. As this is just beginning weeks, I am able to move with the flow of course. The module lecturer, tutor, lab tutor, are very energized towards teaching. The lecture class is full of learning vibes and the presentation of the lecturer has been always exiting. The concepts we learn on lecture class is implemented during tutorial and lab sessions. The tutor always guides us individually in case of problems and confusions. No disappointment has been felt till today in any classes. It’s a hope of mine to complete all the semesters in such innovative environment, exiting teachers. And to get most out of this module, I must be consistent, curious, and energetic. Regular practice of the class activities, consistent habit of learning, presenting the doubts to our teachers need to be carried out for taking maximum output from the module.
                The short and most appropriative way of my personal reflection on this can be: A very best place for learning and moving together. Thank your Islington family for providing the freedom to fly.
